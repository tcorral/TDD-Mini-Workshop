To accomplish this task you need to create a class/object that should:

* Allow us to play a guessing game to guess a number.
* Have a method to start the game.
    * When the game is started a new number to guess is set.
    * The number to guess should be a number from 1 to 6.
        * You can use the class/object of the previous exercise to get the
        number.
* Have a method that should receive an argument
    * The argument should be a number.
    * It should return 'You win!' if the number is the same we set on start
    * It should return 'Sorry. The answer was:X' -> replace X by the number
    we set on start.
